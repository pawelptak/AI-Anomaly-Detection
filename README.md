## Code Structure

The code is splitten into 4 parts.

### AUTOENCODERS

The AUTOENCODERS section contains AI models based on autoencoder concept, inlucding Dense Autoencoder and LSTM autoencoder. Additionally, code for preprocessing and results analysis as well as sample usages for various datasets is included.

For more details please go to the README file inside AUTOENCODERS folder.

### CNN_LSTM

The CNN_LSTM section contains AI models using mostly Convolution Neural Networks but some extensions with LSTM layers were introduced.
Similarly to AUTOENCODERS section preprocessing, analysis and example usages are included.

For more details please go to the README file inside CNN_LSTM folder.

### dense_autoencoder

The dense_autoencode section contains an application to run from command line. The application is based on Dense Autoencoder AI model. The application allows to train the model but also make a prediction using the trained model.

For more details please go to the README file inside dense_autoencoder folder.
